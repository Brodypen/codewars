# My Code wars: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/BrodyPen" >Visit Here</a> 

Codewars became the place for me to consistently practice my coding. This is a repository filled with my codewars answers, and will grow with time!


## How this became to be:

Tech used: JS, TS.

Certain katas don't have TS answers so it defaults to JS. However, I prefer Typescript so I'll try to do TS when I can.

## Optimizations

Before submitting, I take time to optimize and take notes on different ways to optimize in terms of efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned:

Spaced repetition is king and not being able to answer a question by yourself is okay. Many times I have forgotten the syntax and a quick google search helps me out!
